/**
 * A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building. The height of this floor, h, is known.
 *
 * He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66).
 *
 * His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.
 *
 * How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling and bouncing?
 *
 * Three conditions must be met for a valid experiment:
 * Float parameter "h" in meters must be greater than 0
 * Float parameter "bounce" must be greater than 0 and less than 1
 * Float parameter "window" must be less than h.
 * If all three conditions above are fulfilled, return a positive integer, otherwise return -1.
 *
 * Note:
 * The ball can only be seen if the height of the rebounding ball is strictly greater than the window parameter.
 *
 * Example:
 * - h = 3, bounce = 0.66, window = 1.5, result is 3
 *
 * - h = 3, bounce = 1, window = 1.5, result is -1
 *
 * (Condition 2) not fulfilled).
